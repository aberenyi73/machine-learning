    "### Domain Background\n",
    "_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, provide brief details on the background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited in this section, including why that research is relevant. Additionally, a discussion of your personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.\n",

    "LendingClub (LC) is a peer-to-peer lending company. Lending Club operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans.  The company claims that \\$15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to December 31, 2015. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club) Loans can be issued for a variety of reasons. Loans are issued as $25 notes so that lenders diversify their investment over many loans.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[source](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/statistics.action)\n",
    "\n",
    " LC divides loans into categores A,B,C,D,E,FG, based on variables that measure the quality of the loan. A is highest and FG is lowest. Category A loans offers the lowest rate of return backed by borrowes with highest credit rating that are most likely to repay the loan in theory. FG are the riskiest loans, high interest rate but least likely to repay the loan.\n",

    "\n",
    "[source](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/demand-and-credit-profile.action)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a borrower does not return the loan it first becomes late status then charged off after 3 months. If a loan is chared off the investor loses his or her investment. LC collects statistics on borrowers that they decide borrower rating and loan class on. This data is available to download on the LC web site [download-data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action)\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been investing in LC for about 3 years. Over this time period I have invested in a range of loan classes. About 50\\% of the interest earned was erased by load charge-offs. That means that my profit could be doubled if I could identify loans that are more likely to be charged off and not invest in notes from that loan. "

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "_(approx. 1 paragraph)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",

    "The actual investor account returns are significantly lower than the load interest rates precisely because of the charge-off rate. \n",
    "![returns.jpeg](images/returns.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The charge-off rate can be calculated as the percentage of loans with status \"charge-off\" from the data set. The data set contains lots of features that can be indicative of the evetual charge-off of the loan. The potential solution to losing profits is to identify loans that are likely to default and not investing in them. The goal is to identify a correlation between loan features and \"charge-off\". A binary classifier could be a solution to filter out bad loans. After applying the filter the \"charge-off\" rate should drop below the traing data set charge-off rate. The accuracy of the filter should be better than identifying loans by picking randomly. Feature values indicating charge-off within each class A,B,C, etc could be different from each other so it is worth-while investigating each class."

Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included with relevant references and citations as necessary It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.\n",

It contains all the LendingClub loan information available for investors to make a decision about whenter to fund the loan or not. The [LCDataDictionary.xlsx](data/LCDataDictionary.xlsx) file lists the feature with explanation about each feature. The data is in zipped up .csv format that can be imported in Excel, Pandas or other tools. The zipped file size is about 22MB while unzipped it is 110 MB. Each row represents a loan. Each column is a feature. Column \"loan_status\" is the target variable to be predicted.\n",
