    "### Domain Background\n",
    "LendingClub (LC) is a peer-to-peer lending company. LC operates an online lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans.  The company claims that \\$15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to December 31, 2015. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club) Loans can be issued for a variety of purposes, such as loan consolidation, car purchase, medical, etc. Loans are issued as $25 notes so that lenders diversify their investment over many loans. Loan terms are either 36 or 60 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "![loan purpose](images/loan purpose small.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LC divides loans into categores A,B,C,D,E,FG, based on variables that measure the quality of the loan. A is highest and FG is lowest. Category A loans offers the lowest rate of return backed by borrowes with highest credit rating that are most likely to repay the loan in theory. FG are the riskiest loans, high interest rate but least likely to repay the loan.\n",

    "[source](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/demand-and-credit-profile.action)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a borrower does not pay a loan installment on time it goes into `grace period` for 14 days. Then its status goes from `current` to `delinquent`, then `late`, then `charged off` after 3 months. If a loan is chared off the investor loses his or her investment capital plus the potential to earn interest. LC collects statistics on borrowers that they decide borrower rating and loan class on. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have been investing in LC for about 3 years. Over this time period I have invested in a range of loan classes. About 50% of the interest earned was erased by load charge-offs. Identifying loans likely to be charged-off means that investor profit could be doubled by not investing in those notes.

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "_(approx. 1 paragraph)_\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, clearly describe the problem that is to be solved. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem to be solved is predicting which loans will be charge-off (and not investing in them). Charge-offs impact investor returns because investors lose both principal invested in the charged off Notes and the potential to receive interest from such Notes. \n",
    "\n",
    "![chargeoff-small.jpeg](images/chargeoff-small.jpeg)\n",
    "[source](https://blog.lendingclub.com/5-key-things-know-investing-lendingclub-notes/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The charge-off rate can be calculated as the percentage of loans with status \"charge-off\" from the data set. The data set contains both loan and borrower features that can be indicative of the evetual charge-off of the loan. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to identify a correlation between loan features and \"charge-off\". I am planning to train a classifier on the data set to classify loans as \"charge-off\" vs. \"non-charge-off\". The classifier then can be tested for validity on a testing data set. LC publishes the list of loans rejected and this data set can be a good cross-reference for the validity of the classifier, althought the exact criteria LC uses are not known. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained classifier should perform better than a naive classifier. The naive classifier would randomly classify a load as charge-off with the same probability as the percentage of actual `charge-off` loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "After applying the filter the \"charge-off\" rate should drop below the traing data set charge-off rate. The accuracy of the filter should be better than identifying loans by picking randomly. Feature values indicating charge-off within each class A,B,C, etc could be different from each other so it is worth-while investigating each class."

    "### Datasets and Inputs\n",
    "The borrower data used for this project is publicly available on the LC web site [download-data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). It contains all the LendingClub loan information available for investors to make a decision about whenter to fund the loan or not. The [LCDataDictionary.xlsx](data/LCDataDictionary.xlsx) file lists the feature with explanation about each feature. The data is in zipped up .csv format that can be imported in Excel, Pandas or other tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "I am planning to use the Q4 2017 data set initially. This data set should contain a mix of 3yr and 5yr loans that originated up to 5 years ago and new newer loans, with all possible status. The Q4 2017 data set contains anonymized information for about 119,000 loans with 153 features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The zipped file size is about 22MB while unzipped it is 110 MB. Each row represents a loan. Each column is a feature. Column \"loan_status\" is the target variable to be predicted. The finacial data set is donwloadable in quarterly and yearly chunks. \n",
    "These features relate information about the loand and the borrower: `loan amount, interest rate, grade, purpose; borrower income, geography, employment status, FICO score, etc.` This information will be used to find a good indicator (predictor) of why a borrower may default on a loan. "
