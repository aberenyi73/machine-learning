    "### Domain Background\n",
    "Lending Club (LC) operates an online, peer-to-peer lending platform that enables borrowers to obtain a loan, and investors to purchase notes backed by payments made on loans.  The company claims that \\$15.98 billion in loans had been originated through its platform up to December 31, 2015. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lending_Club) Loans can be issued for a variety of purposes, such as loan consolidation, car purchase, medical, etc. Loans are issued as $25 notes so that lenders may diversify their investment over many loans. Loan terms are either 36 or 60 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "![loan purpose](images/loan purpose small.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "LC divides loans into categores A,B,C,D,E,FG, based on variables that measure the quality of the loan. A is highest and FG is lowest. Category A loans offers the lowest rate of return backed by borrowes with highest credit rating therefore it is the safest investment. FG are the riskiest loans with high interest rate but least likely to be repaid.\n",
    "\n",
    "![interest%20rate.jpeg](images/interest%20rate%20small.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "[source](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/demand-and-credit-profile.action)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a borrower does not pay a loan installment on time, its status changes from `current` to `grace period` for 14 days. After that the loan status changes to `delinquent`, then to `late`, then `charged off` after 3 months if not paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been investing in LC for about 3 years. Over this time period I have invested in a range of loan classes. About 50% of the interest earned was erased by load charge-offs. Identifying loans likely to be charged-off means that investor profit could be increased by not investing in those notes.

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem to be solved is to identify which loans are likely to be charge-off. Charge-offs impact investor returns because investors lose both investment capital plus the potential to earn interest. "

    "To solve this problem we need to identify a correlation between loan features and \"charge-off\" probability. I am planning to train a classifier on the data set to classify loans as \"charge-off\" vs. \"non-charge-off\". \n",
    "\n",
    "To quantify the problem: the charge-off rate can be calculated as the percentage of loans with status \"charge-off\" from the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "To measure performance: The trained classifier should perform better than a naive classifier; it should identify charge-off loans to a greater accuracy than a naive classifier. The naive classifier picks notes randomly with the same probability as the percentage of actual `charge-off` loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "To replicate the results: The classifier then can be tested for validity on a testing data set. LC publishes the list of loans rejected and this data set can be a good cross-reference for the validity of the classifier, althought the exact criteria LC uses are not known. "

    "### Datasets and Inputs\n",
    "LC collects extensive statistics on borrowers that they make their rating based on. The borrower data used for this project is publicly available on the LC web site [download-data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action). It contains all the LendingClub loan information available for investors to make a decision about whenter to fund the loan or not. The [LCDataDictionary.xlsx](data/LCDataDictionary.xlsx) file lists the feature with explanation about each feature. The data is in zipped up .csv format that can be imported in Excel, Pandas or other tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "This data set should contain a mix of 3yr and 5yr loans that originated up to 5 years ago and new newer loans, with all possible status. For example the Q1 2017 data set contains anonymized information for about 96,781 loans with 151 features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The zipped file size is about 22MB while unzipped it is 110 MB. Each row represents a loan. Each column is a feature. Column \"loan_status\" is the target variable to be predicted. The finacial data set is donwloadable in quarterly and yearly chunks. \n",
    "These features relate information about the loand and the borrower: `loan amount, interest rate, grade, purpose; borrower income, geography, employment status, FICO score, etc.` This information will be used to find a good indicator (predictor) of why a borrower may default on a loan. "

    "### Solution Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data exploration\n",
    "The LC data set contains both loan and borrower features that can be indicative of the evetual charge-off of the loan. Feature values indicating charge-off within each class A,B,C, etc could be different from each other so it is worth-while investigating each class. \n",
    "In the preliminary data exploration I will investigate each feature. I will calculate statistics to determine if they need to be normalized, encoded, missing values supplied, appropriate imputation strategy selected. Variable distributions will be investigated and if appropriate features will be scaled, combined or omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model\n",
    "I am planing to compare DecisionTree, SVM, NeuralNet, KNN and other classifier performances. It may be useful to investigate dimensionality reduction to reduce the number of input dimensions by Principal Component Analysis and clustering. I will select the best parameters for the classifier using GridSearch and a scoring function using recall_score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Metric\n",
    "I am planning to measure performance by Recall.\n",
    "The recall is the ratio tp / (tp + fn) where tp is the number of true positives and fn the number of false negatives. The recall is intuitively the ability of the classifier to find all the positive samples (charge-offs). This problem is similar to a fraud detector where we aim to catch all positive cases. We don't want a very high rate of False positives either because that would eliminate valid investment opportunities, so reporting a Precision score is also meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluating performance\n",
    "To measure performance: The trained classifier should perform better than a naive classifier; it should identify charge-off loans with a better Recall than a naive classifier. The naive classifier picks notes randomly with the same probability as the percentage of actual `charge-off` loans.\n",
